EShop is web application that I created as my own project to improve my angular programing skills. It is simple web shop application that could be used in any
web shop business. I developed most important functionalities. To develope this app I used angular, typescript, javascript, services, routing.

As backend I used NODE.js and Express.js. I wanted to learn node.js and that is why I choose it for backend and I used express.js to make it easier.
As database I used MongoDB. I already have some experiance with Sql databases and this was my first time to work with mongodb. 

In this app we have home page or deals. That is page where all action items are shown. We can also chose man, women or kids page where we can see all items that are not on sale. It is possible to add to shopping cart items where total price par item and also total price of shopping cart will be automaticly calculated. 

To order something you dont have to be registered. Only admin have to be registered to be able to modify, add or remove items.
